## Development

Use these commands to install dependencies and to run `gatsby develop` for development purposes.

```
yarn install
yarn develop
```

### Testing RSS feed and/or Structured data

The feed is only generated when using `yarn build`, so to test it first we need to build and then serve:

```
yarn build
gatsby serve
```

### Using the forked remote dependency

```
yarn upgrade {package}@{repository}#{branch}
yarn upgrade @narative/gatsby-theme-novela@https://github.com/mabasic/gatsby-theme-novela.git#bugfix/component-shadowing
```

#### Known issues

1. Can't get this method to work because the forked repository contains yarn workspaces while the theme npm package contains just the theme. **Hint:** Look into git submodules and subtree.
